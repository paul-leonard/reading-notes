### Class 27: Django Models

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Using Models](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models)
- Models are Python objects
- The fields and arguments in the models are used to interact w the underlying database
- The dev does not have to do anything with the database, django handles it all
- You should define a UML of how the modes interact
- It should also show how many instances of each model are associated w another mode
- They are defined in models.py
- Fields will be stored as columns in our db
- Order they are defined is the order they will show up in a form unless default values are changed
- Model can also have methods
- Define Dunder strings
- Have to re-migrate the db

1. [Django Admin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Admin_site)
- Models need to be registered w the admin site
- Use admin site to input real instances of the models
- Admin site can be improved
- Django will automatically create forms for record entry on admin page
- These forms are good for testing out structure of models and data, but should not be used in production
- Register models in admin.py
