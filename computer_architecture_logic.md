[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-](Watch the educational videos produced by code.org on their youtube channel.)

These videos are truly educational, informative, and inspiring.  They break down the basics of computers, hardware, and software in a simple way that brings so much more understanding to the modern computers we know and love.  The animations and visual graphics extremely effectively communicate the points and concepts.  I highly recommend watching these videos.
