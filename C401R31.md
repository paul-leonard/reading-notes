### Class 31: Django REST Framework & Docker

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Beginner’s Guide to Docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)
- complicated under the hood, but very useful
- replaces virtual environments
- allows all teammates to work in the same environment across computer systems
- Linux containers are becoming popular; which is a type of virtualization
- building virtual machines starting with a Linux base saves on memory and processing
- building from Linux base is called containerization; Docker is an implementation of that
- Python virtual environments we are used to only make virtual the version of Python that we are running (and that version of Python is still installed on the overall computer)
- Containerization makes virtual the version of Python that we are running ?maybe duplicate?, creates production databases, and makes sure our environment is truly standalone
- Install Docker via desktop App (at least version 19) `docker --version`
- Docker Compose is a helpful tool.  Check install with `docker-compose --version`
- Can test install using `docker run hello-world`
- helpful/informative commands: `docker info`, `docker image ls`, and `docker image ls -la`
- *Image* snapsot in time of what a project contains
- *Container* running instance of an image



1. [Django for APIs - Library Website](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/)
- Django REST Framework and Django Web Framework are different
- They work alongside each other
- Django REST Framework can only be added to a project that already uses Django Web Framework
- Django Web Framework creates websites made up of web pages
- Django Web Framework creates URL endpoints that return JSON data
- Django REST Framework is added as a third-party app
- Provides visualization of API responses
