**Key Concetpts**
- *Building Blocks* Every HTML element is treated as a block.  This includes block-level and inline elements.
- *Containing Elements* If an HTML element sits inside or is nested in another HTML block element, the outer most box is called the containg or parent element.  '<div>' elements are frequently used for this purpose.

**Positioning Schemes**
Website design using CSS typically takes one of the five listed positioning schemes to determine where each HTML block element is shown on the webpage.
1. Normal Flow (browswer default)
1. Realitive Positioning
1. Absolute Positioning
1. Fixed Positioning
1. Floating Elements (moves content to the left or the right of the page, requires defined width of element)

Websites can be viewed on a variety of devices and a large range of screen sizes.  All of this must be considered when designing a webpage and establishing its layout.  *Liquid layouts* improve the attractiveness of a webpage by adjusting the layout to the screen, unlike *fixed width layouts*.

*CSS Frameworks* provide base CSS code as a template to alleviate the need to start each website from scratch.  While they save time, they contain more code than would be needed and the class descriptors are defined to refer to presentation instead of content of the HTML elements.

Multiple style sheets can be used for a given webpage.  This modular approach allows things such as layout to be seperated from colors and fonts.

**Importance in Pixels**
- Keep the main info of the site within the top 600 pixels to show it to the reader before scrolling is required.
- Width should be between 960-1000
