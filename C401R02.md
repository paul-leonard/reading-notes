### Class 2: Testing and Modules

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)
- unit tests are the simplest level of tests to confirm that a script or function provides the correct feedback for a case of input
- TDD is test driven development
- TDD says to define the tests first, and then write the code to pass the tests
- tests should go in a seperate folder
- test code should be comprised of three sections:  Arrange, Act, Assert
- TDD has a three step cycle: write a test, write the feature code and show the test passes, then refactor the code
- think about software dsign first
- easy to retest your code after changes


1. [Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)
- Recursion is when a function calls itself again
- It can occur directly or indirectly
- Directly is if it calls it
- Indirectly is if it calls something else that in return ends up with it getting called again
- base condition is the case that stops the nesting pattern and returns a number first
- stack overflow can occur if a base condition never occurs
- tailed recursion when the last thing the function does is call itself again
- many problems can be solved recursively or iteratively
- iteratively will require less overall memory while recursively will provide for simpler and cleaner code
