#### Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery (pages 293-301, 306-331 and 354-357)
- jQuery is a tool to allow you find elements through use of CSSS-style selectors and then take an action on those elements.
- A jQuery JS file must be included in your web page for it to work.
- jQuery has two steps: Find the element and then do something with it.
- A function with the notation `$('selector')` creates a jQuery object.
- Use of the tool makes coding simpler and reduces lines of code.
- One or many elements can be returned by jQuery.
- jQuery methods can retrieve info and/or modify info depending on type of element.
- Use of the `ready()` event allows you to know jQuery is ready to be used.
- `.each` allows you to do something to each individual result of the jQuery.
- Event handling makes use of the event object.
- jQuery is added as a JS script source in the HTML code by linking to a CDN.


#### [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
Pair programming is two software developers working together.  One is in a navigator role and the other is in a driver role.  Six main benefits to students who use pair programming are:
1. Increased efficiency
1. Engaged collaboration
1. Learning from your partner
1. Practice social skills
1. Practice for job interviews by talking the talk
1. Work environment prepardness

#### Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery (pages 332-335 and 302-305)
- jQuery methods can be used to animate and change the display on web pages
- There are additonal selectors that can be used in addition to typical CSS selectors
- These pages have long lists for reference of selectors and possible methods to use on the returned object.
