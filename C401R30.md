### Class 30: Hash Tables

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Code Fellows: Intro to Hash Tables](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-30/resources/Hashtables.html)
- Hash: result of a function taking in a string and converting it into a value.  That value could be used for security purposes or to represent the location of information.
- Buckets: A bucket is contained in each index of a list for a hashtable.  The bucket could contain multiple sets of information in the event of a collision.
- Collision: Occurs when more than one key is assigned the same value location.


1. [Video:  What is a hash table?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0)
- Hash tables were visually explained using a name:phone number example
- A dictionary contains the location of the information, instead of the information
- The information is actually stored in a list
- After knowing the location of the information, we can look it up at its list index
- If multiple things are attempted to be stored at that list index, we create a list within that individual index (list in a list)
