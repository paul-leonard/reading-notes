#### Duckett: HTML & CSS

##### Chapter 4: Links (pages 74-93)
Links are a defining feature of HTML and now websites in general.  Links can go to other websites, help the user navigate to other pages of the current website, autoscroll to a position on the current website, and open an email to send.  Links URLs can be given as a relative link if it is in close proximity within the website's directory.

*Link Syntax*
'<a href="linkToGoTo">titleToShowReader</a>'

#### Chapter 15: Layout (pages 358-404; focus on pages 358-404)
Websites can be viewed on a variety of devices and a large range of screen sizes.  All of this must be considered when designing a webpage and establishing its layout.  *Liquid layouts* improve the attractiveness of a webpage by adjusting the layout to the screen, unlike *fixed width layouts*.

*Positioning Schemes*
- Normal Flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute Positioning

*Box Offset*
- Fixed Positioning
- Floating Elements



#### Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

##### Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects (first part: pages 86-99)
**Functions** are a code block consisting of related statemetns that have been grouped together because they have a common objective.  This code block is given a name so that it can be referenced elsewhere and used again.  Functions are usually made of code blocks that must be repeated frequently on a website.

Functions must be declared and then seperately called.  Syntax for this can be found on page 90 and 91.

Functions can accept a single input, multiple inputs, or no inputs to use within their code block.  Likewise, functions can output a single value, multiple values, or no values.  However, functions can only write to one variable.  Therefore, if you would like to get multiple values out of a funciton, you must use an array.
