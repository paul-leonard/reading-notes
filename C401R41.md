### Class 41: React 1

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview](https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/)
- written as a comparison between ES5 and ES6 syntax
- offers examples of simple siutations demonstrating syntax
- excellent review of high level syntax for ES6 for transitioning from Python
- interesting how ES6 moved JS to be more like Python


1. [React- Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- multipage tutorial with content presented in sepecific order
- first 6 tutorials are linked below and build on each other
- helpful and concise explanations and definition of terms
- interesting that the documentation refers to "we" a lot
* [React - Hello World](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- so far react looks very simple
* [React - JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- JSX is a library
- allows for writing HTML code blocks as a type of variable that is not necessarily a string
- can contain children
- prevents injection attacks
- Babel compiles JSX down to React Elements
* [React - Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)
- `ReactDOM.render` method is used to pass the element to add/modify and the target HTML id to render an element to the DOM
- elements cannot be modified, but they can be overwritten
- when elements are overwritten, only the part that actually changed is modified in the DOM
* [React - Components & Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- JS Functions can be used to intake *props* (properties) and create React Elements
* [React - State & Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
- can use classes instead of functions
- can add local state into the class
- lifecycle methods of the class
* [React - Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- handling events with React elements only has minor syntax differences to handling events with HTML
- events are named with camelCase like JavaScript instead of lowercase like HTML
- functions are passed in as the event handler, instead of a string



**Skimming/Bookmark Material for the Assignment**
1. [React - Installation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- need an id tag to target and to import the React JS scripts


1. [React - Comprehensive Guide](https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/)
- in depth guide that looks nicely done


1. [Understanding Variables, Scope, and Hoisting in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-variables-scope-hoisting-in-javascript)
- three ways to define variables in JS:  var, const, let
- if not changing, use const
- try to use as many consts as possible
- if need it to be mutable, then use let
- let and const contain the variable definition to blocks to prevent overwriting other variables
- only var is hoisted
- hoisting means the variable is initialized before execution of the script
- when hoisted, the variable is created, but not given a value
- var variables being hoisted can lead to "undefined" values when the variable is referenced before being assigned
- using const and let variables can lead to "ReferenceError: x is not defined" errors when the variables is referenced before being assigned
