#### [Code Fellows Summary: Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)
The process of creating, in code, a conceptual model to address a specific problem is known as *domain modeling**.  **Object-oriented** models create an entity that stores both data and behaviors.  The first is kept in *properties* and the second is contained in *methods*.



#### Duckett: HTML & CSS

##### Chapter #6: Tables (pages 126-145)
There are four key elements to create a table.
- '''<table>''' tag element is used to add a table.
- '''<tr>''' is used to create each row.
- The number of rows is defined for each row.  For the header, it is defined by '''<th>'''.  For the rows in the body, the tag '''<td>''' tag is used.
- Attributes such as '''rowspan''' and '''colspan''' can be used to effectively "merge cells" and have a cell go across multiple rows or columns.
- Large tables can be broken up using tags to divide it into the 'thead', 'tbody', and 'tfoot'.



#### Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

##### Chapter #3: Functions, Methods, and Objects (pages 106-144)
- A model of something in the world is repreented by an *object*.
- Objects are defined by parameters and methods.
- Methods are the same as functions, but are internal to objects.
- Parameters are the same as variales, but are internal to objects.
- Objects can be created using **literal notation** or **constructor notation**.
- Literal notation spells everything out and defines each parameter and method at the time of object declaration.
- A constructor function can be used to create many instances of an object when you need to model similar items.
- Keywords that exist in JavaScript can be used to add **'''new'''** objects or **'''delete'''** a property of an object.
- Objects are created by web browsers to model both the document being presented and browswer window.
- Everything in JavaScript is an object.  As such, things like strings, numbers, math, and date are objects.  We can use their parameters and methods to glean helpful information.  Example: '''stringVariable.length''' and ''' stringVariable.toLowerCase()'''.
- Arrays can go in objects.  And objects can go in arrays.  [Cat in the Hat Rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNR-A3gBzfs})
