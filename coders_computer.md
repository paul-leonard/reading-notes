### The Coder's Computer: Environment for Writing Code

#### Text Editor
Text Editor is a program the developer can use to write code.  Many different text editors exist and the choice of which one to use depends on personal preference and objective.

##### Options

- Gedit
- Atom by GitHub
- NotePad++
- Text Wrangler
- BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code by Microsoft

##### Considerations for Choosing

+ Syntax highlighting - *greatly improves readability and error recognition*
+ Variety of brightness/contrast themes
+ Selection of extensions/plug-ins - *Example: Emmet increase efficency*
+ References and wikis

## About Me
Thank you for visiting my page of notes.  I hope they were helpful to you.  Please also check out [my GitHub portfolio page](https://github.com/paul-leonard "Paul's GitHub Portfolio").

After graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from *Missouri University of Science and Technology* 13 years ago, I moved out to Seattle and started work at Boeing.  While there, I worked in airplane modifications, flight test, and flight controls design engineering.  I am super excited to return to a rich learning environment and gain some new programming skills.  I plan to complete the full course path ending with a specialty in Python.  I enjoy spending time outside by camping and hiking or having a beer at a brewery with friends (when that is a thing again).
