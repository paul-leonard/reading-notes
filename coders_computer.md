### The Coder's Computer: Environment for Writing Code

#### Text Editor
Text Editor is a program the developer can use to write code.  Many different text editors exist and the choice of which one to use depends on personal preference and objective.

##### Available Text Editors
- Notepad
- Text Edit
- Gedit
- Atom by GitHub
- NotePad++
- Text Wrangler
- BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code by Microsoft
- Atom
- Brackets by Adobe
- Sublime Text

##### Considerations for Choosing
+ Code completion - *autocompletes syntax to reduce keystrokes and typos*
+ Syntax highlighting - *greatly improves readability and error recognition*
+ Variety of brightness/contrast themes
+ Selection of extensions/plug-ins - *Example: Emmet increase efficency*
+ References and wikis
+ Zoom features
+ Live preview

##### The Full Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
The text editor is a one segment of what combines with other functional software to form the Integrated Development Environment.  The other suplemental software packages include a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger.

#### The Terminal

>Your window into the computer.
>- Ryan's Tutorial

##### The Command Line
The **Command Line Interface** (CLI) is the textual interface for issuing commands to the computer.  The computer prompts the user for an entry.  The user enters a command.  The command can be further modified by using options or arguments.  Options are usually lead by a '-'.  Often, the computer will return outputs following a command.  Other times, the command simply runs a background process. The return of the computer's prompt to the user signifies the completion of the previous command.

A shell is used and determines the display, format, and behavior of the terminal.  Bash is the most common shell and is short for Bourne again shell.


##### Basic Navigation


Here are some basic commands as an example:
Command   |   Description
---   |   ---
pwd   |   present working directory
ls   |   list
mkdir   |   make directory
touch   |   creates new file (ex.  Touch students.txt)
cd   |   change directory
cd..   |   back one directory
cd../..   |   back two directories
echo   |   use to display a system variable
up arrow   |   get to previous commands
down arrow   |   get to more recent commands

## About Me
Thank you for visiting my page of notes.  I hope they were helpful to you.  Please also check out [my GitHub portfolio page](https://github.com/paul-leonard "Paul's GitHub Portfolio").

After graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from *Missouri University of Science and Technology* 13 years ago, I moved out to Seattle and started work at Boeing.  While there, I worked in airplane modifications, flight test, and flight controls design engineering.  I am super excited to return to a rich learning environment and gain some new programming skills.  I plan to complete the full course path ending with a specialty in Python.  I enjoy spending time outside by camping and hiking or having a beer at a brewery with friends (when that is a thing again).
