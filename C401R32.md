# Paul's Reading Notes

## Code #401

### Class 32: Permissions & Postgresql

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [DRF Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)
- authentication/identification is different than authorization
- permissions determine whether requests should be allowed (granted) or denied after considering authentication and throttling
- the simplest permission is `IsAuthenticated` which only allows full access if the requestor is identified
- the next simplest is `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` which allows read access to everyone
- permission classes
- before the main body of code is run, permissions are checked
- HTTP 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden are typical responses when authorization is denied
- authorization can also be used to determine if a user can modify or access a particular object, such as a model instance
- subclassing object permissions may be necessary
- often have to filter queryset to account for object permissions, because generic views will not
- can set default persmission policy on a global level
- if not spefified, no restrictions are implemented
- there are many permission classes available for use, or you can create a custom one
- third party packages are available to make more complex permission classes
