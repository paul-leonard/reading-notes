### Class 13: Update/Delete | Sending Form Data

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Sending Form Data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data)
- HTML form is nothing more than an easy to fill out user-friendly way to create an HTTP request
- The *action* attribute must be set correctly and valid.
- The action attribute determines where the information will be sent and is n absolute or realitive URL.
- If invalid info is given, it will be sent to the web address the form resides in.
- If the action attribute URL includes HTTPS, then the request containing the form information will be encrypted.
- non-file form controls are sent as part of the request using *name=value* pairing.
- server file should be ready to receive, validate, process, and refresh a page at the action defined route
- The *method* attribute defines how the data is sent via HTML protocol.
- The two most common methods are *GET* and *POST*
- GET puts the form information in the URL address
- POST puts the information in the body of the request
- can use Chrome Developer Tools to view the HTTP request
- Retrieving the data depends on what development platform you use
- of the many options, we have been using a high quality framework, Express for Node.js
- security is important; never trust a user account... could be hijacked
- sanitize and check all incoming data to your server
- make sure not executable code is sent
- limit the incoming data
- have a sandbox or side server that stores the collected data
- security reviews are a good idea
