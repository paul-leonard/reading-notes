##### Chapter #10: Error Handling and Debugging (pages 449-486)

Everyone makes mistakes when writing code.  And that's why error handling and debugging is important.  Three things can help make it easier.
1. The Console and Dev Tools
1. Knowledge of Common Error and Problems
1. Handling Errors

Understanding the order of execution is important to solving errors.  It will help you think through the script like the computer does.  It will also let you know what has run successfully and what has been a hang up in the script.

The Stack:  JS acts on one line of code at a time.  If the current line of code requires other data from a different line of code, JS stacks that one on top to run first.

JS has 7 types of built in errors:
1. Error
1. Syntax Error
1. ReferenceError
1. TypeError
1. RangeError
1. URIError
1. EvalError

Debugging is all about deduction.  You have to eliminate possible causes of the error.  It is best to start in the most likely place and/or the easiest to check.  It is important to identify where the problem is and what exactly is the problem.

Browser dev tools and the JavaScript Console are very important in helping to find errors.

The statements 'try', 'catch', and 'finally' can help you gracefully handle errors.
