### Class 5: Design web pages with CSS

**Reading Material for the Assignment**
Read the chapters of *Duckett: HTML & CSS* in the following order:  Chapters 10 (skim), 11 (read)



#### Intro to CSS
- CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- This seperate file of code uses attributes, classes, and id's within the HTML code to style the website to be appealing.
- What to affect is determined by the *selector*.
- What to do to the selector is defined by the *declaration*.
- *Declarations* are made up of *property* and *value* inputs.
- CSS can affect everything from background color, to image sizing, text postion, and even font.
- CSS code is kept seperate in order to make troubleshooting more efficent.


#### Colors
Selecting color for your website is very important part of design.  There are many elements that can have colors defined and the color possibilities are endless.  The Adobe Color Wheel can help you choose a color scheme that provides appropriate contrast and is pleasing to the eye.  It can also make sure your website is accessible for colorblind people.  You can also change the Opacity of colors in CSS3.

There are three ways you can define color:
- RGB values
- HEX codes
- color names
