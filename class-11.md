##### Chapter 9: Flash (historical) (pages 201-206)
Flash was very big for awhile and supplied animations, video, and audio to websites.  However, as other technologies became available, it became less needed.  When Apple chose not to support flash on iPhones, it likely set off the final decline of Flash.

##### Chapter #16: Images (pages 406-427)
This chapter contains information on how to make your website more visually appealing by using CSS to size and align images, as well as add background images.  **Rollovers** is the use of changing out images as a user puts their mouse over an image.  One method of doing this is called a **sprite** which uses only one image and background changes to speed up website loading times.
