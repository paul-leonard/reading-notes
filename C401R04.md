## Code #401

### Class 4: Classes and Objects; Thinking Recursively; Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
- Objects contain variables and functions
- Classes serve as a template for related objects
- access object variables and methods by using dot notation
- if you make two objects from one class and then change one of the object's variables, the other object's variable is not changed


1. [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
- Recursive functions refer to themselves in their defnitions 
- Recursive functions have two parts:  the base case and the recursive case
- Recursive functions lead to a callstack filled with the same function
- The first function called in the stack is the last one completed
- The state must be passed between each call of the function
- Two ways to do this: Pass the state to each recursive call at the time of call, or keep the state in the global variable scope
- Some data structures, such as lists, can be created in a recursive way
- And with that, somehow recursive functions and data structures can work together


1. [Pytest Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)
- When writing a lot of tests, you may want some information common across all of them.
- This shared test information can be shared via **Fixtures**
- Fixtures are identified by decorators
- **Coverage** is a measure of how well the test suite covers the code
- coverage can be summarized in a human readable report
