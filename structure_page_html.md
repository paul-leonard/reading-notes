### Class 4:  Structure Web Pages with HTML

**Reading Material for the Assignment**
Read the chapters of *Duckett: HTML & CSS* in the following order:  Chapters 18 (read), 1 (skim), 17 (read), 8 (read)

#### HTML & CSS, Chapter 18:  Process & Design (read)

There is a lot of work to develop and design a website before the programming and coding even starts!  The goals and objectives for the website, the hosting organization, and the visitor must be considered.  What is the user demographic, what information is trying to be shared with the user, how often will they visit, and what are the visitors trying to achieve.

To begin a website, the organization and layout must be designed.  Putting work in at this point, will help define a logical site map that will be intuitive to the user and prevent coding rework.  *Card Sorting* is a key process to help identify the optimal site map.

Next up is designing the layout of each individual webpage.  THis is done through drawing up wireframes.  When working on teams, it helps the team have a clear and collective vision.  Design strategies to consider when designing the page include:
- Visual hierarchy
- Grouping and Similarity
- Navigation presentation


#### HTML & CSS, Chapter 1:  Structure (skim)
Websites need structure.  It is provided by HTML code which is written in text.  The structure is made up of elements which is defined in the code by using tags.  Tags '</>' have opening and closing statements.  The opening statement may include additional attribute definition in order to adjust the details of the wesbiste.


#### HTML & CSS, Chapter 17:  HTML5 Layout (read)
HTML5 is the newest version of HTML and is realatively recent.  Some older browsers do not support it, so code must be written to handle various browser versions.  (JavaScript scripts can help with this.)  HTML5 introduced more descriptive and semantic element tags to make the code clearer and easier to understand for humans.


#### HTML & CSS, Chapter 8:  Extra Markup (read)
There are many versions of HTML, so DOCTYPES are used to tell the browser which version the code is written in.  Commenting code is extremely helpful for other people and you in understanding what different areas accomplish.  Particular elements within HTML can be identified using 'id' and 'class' attributes so that they can be referenced by CSS style files later.  '<iframes>' allows other webpages to display within your webpage.
