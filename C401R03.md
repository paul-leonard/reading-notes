### Class 3: FileIO & Exceptions

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Read & Write Files in Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)
- a file stores data through a set of bytes
- files typically have three main parts:  header, data, and End of File (EOF)
- two main types of file extensions are .txt and .csv, but there are thousands out there
- 3 things to access a file:  folder path, file name, and extension
- There needs to be a symbol to indicate line ending
- Most commonly these are CR or LF characters.  Also \r\n.
- Two most common encoding types are ASCII and UNICODE
- Encoding represents human readable characters with a number
- Always close a file after you open it
- use `open()` to open it and `close()` to close it
- Two ways to make sure you close the file after using it: `try:/finally:` and `with open('filename') as localname:`
- these methods account for errors occuring while using the file
- second optional argument for the `open()` command is the mode you want to read in
- mode defaults to read, but can also be chosen as 'r', 'w', 'rb', or 'wb'
- 3 categories of file objects: text, buffered binary, raw binary
- command options for reading data from file: `.read(size=1)`, `.readline(size=1)`, `.readlines()`, or `list(file)`
- there are libraries to work with common file types



1. [Exceptions in Python](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)
- a Python program terminates immeadiately following the occurance of an error
- errors can be a syntax or exception
- syntax errors are identified when the parser finds an incorrect statement
- you can also raise exceptions
- they can include error messages
- `assert` can be used for tests
- `try:/finally:`
- `try:/except:/else:` can be used to have three groupings of code (run this, if error happens then run this, if error didn't happen then also do this)
- `finally:` will always run and can be added on
