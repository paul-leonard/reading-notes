### Class 8: List Comprehensions (Game of Greed 3)

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [List Comprehensions](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python)
- List comprehensions are a simple one liner way to fill a list following some simple rules.
- Now that we understand what is happening with for loops, conditionals, and appends... we can do it all together
- The basic syntax: `[ expression for item in list if conditional ]`
- you can add in multiple conditionals
- You can split a string of numbers up using `[x for x in string if x.isdigit()]`
- You can reference a function as your expression
- For loops can be nested, such as `[x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]`
