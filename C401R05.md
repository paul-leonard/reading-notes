### Class 5: Linked Lists

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Linked Lists](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)
- Data structure
- each element in it is a node
- can be singly or doubly
- singly's carry the node value and the next node address
- doubly's carry those two things plus the address of the previous node
- "head" represents the first node in the list
- the last node's "next address" is equal to `null`
- cannot use a for loop or foreach (JS) with them.  Must use a while loop.
- With regards to searching, Big O(n) for time because the element we are looking for may be at the end
- With regards to searching, Big O(1) for memory because nothing more is being used
- This page also includes some wonderful visuals for inserting nodes at various positions



1. [What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt1](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-1-d8b7e6508b9d)
- Linear vs non-linear data structure types
- linear is all in order, one path
- arrays require the data to all be in one place
- linked lists can have their data scattered all around
- this makes linked lists have some good memory advantages
- linked lists are dynamic
- arrays are static
- circular linked lists exist


1. [What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt2](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-2-131d96f71996)
- Another overview of Big O
- to add to an array, we may have to move the whole array and touch every value inside of it
- to add to a linked list, we just need to create our new node and update the previous node to provide the address for the new node
- It is Big O(1) for inserting at the beginning
- It is Big O(n) for inserting at the end because we have to read through the whole list of nodes to find the end
- both linked lists and arrays have advantages
- linked lists are great if you will be adding and subtracting elements
- linked lists are not so good at searching
- this page also includes a good checklist for choosing between arrays or linked lists
