#### Duckett: HTML & CSS

##### Chapter 2: Text (pages 40-61)
HTML elements describe the structure of the page and can also place emphasis or focus on pieces of content by providing semantic information.

##### Chapter 10: Introducing CSS (pages 226-245)
CSS rules provide style to an HTML structure file through rules.  Each rule is made up of a **Selector** and a **Declaration**.  A Declaration is made up of a **property** and its assigned **value**.

*External CSS* | CSS can be stored in a seperate file when the HTML file links to the style sheet.
*Internal CSS* | CSS can be written inline with HTML code in the HTML file using the '<style>' tag.

There are various Selectors available for calling out HTML elements by type, class, ID, or through family structure.  The more specific the rule, the higher priority that style assignment has.  This is where the name Cascading Style Sheets comes from.



#### Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

##### Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions (pages 53-84)
A JavaScript code file is a series of statements (or instructions) for the computer to follow.

Comments can be made within the code using '/* comment */' for multiline comments.  '//' can be used for single line comments.

Variables are defined using the 'var' keyword.  Variables are assgined a value using a single '='.  To store a character string as a variable, the string must be inside of single quotes.  To use quotes within a string, the '\' escape character must be used.

An array is a variable type that stores a list of values.

*Expressions* make use of *operators* to resolve multiple inputs into a single output value.
Typical arithmetic operators are available.  Additionally, special string operators are available.  The most important of which is **concatenation**.

##### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops (pages 145-162)
Decisions are made within programs by using conditional statements.  There are two main parts of these conditional statements.  First is the *evaluation of a condition* and then are the *conditional statements* to be possibly be executed.  If/else and Switch statements are the two main types.

###### Comparison Operators Evaluating Conditions
Compares the value of two operands.

Code | Use
--- | ---
== | Is equal to
=== | strict equal to
> | greater than
< | less than
!= | is not equal to
!== | strict not equal to
>= | greater than or equal to
<= | less than or equal to

###### Logical Operators
Logical operators allow you to compare multiple comparison operators.

Code | Use
--- | ---
&& | logical and
|| | logical or
! | logical not
