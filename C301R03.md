#### [Templating with Mustache](https://medium.com/@1sherlynn/javascript-templating-language-and-engine-mustache-js-with-node-and-express-f4c2530e73b2)
- mustache is a JavaScript library
- it provides a templating convention for creating HTML code
- its use reduces code making it easier to write and read
- mustache-express is even briefer in nature
- mustache uses a placeholder defined in the HTML head
- the syntax is: `{{ name }}`

)
- I found this guide during Code201 and love it!  So visual and well organized.
- cross axis goes down the page
- main axis works left to right on the page
- flex items are put inside of a flex container
