### Class 7: Python Scope and Big O (Game of Greed 2)
**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)
- Python is a scoped language
- The priority of scope is LEGB:  **Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in**
- Can modify standard scope behavior by using *global* and *nonlocal*
- Global scope means you can access the variable anywhere
- Local scope variables are only available within a certain region of the program's code
- Global programs run into bugs and difficulty during troubleshooting due to variables being overwritten
- *In scope* is when you can access a given variable
- *Out of scope* is when you cannot access a given variable
- Scope is determined by Python based on where you assign or define the variable
- If a variable is assigned inside of a function defintiion, then it is only available within that function's local scope
- If a variable is assigned outside of all functions, then it has global scope for that file
- "Python scopes are implemented as *dictionaries* that map names to objects" and are commonly called *namespaces*
- These mechanisms for storing the names and values are in a special attribute called *.__dict__*.



1. [Donâ€™t be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uqawfl0VHQ)
- Another perspective on Big O
- Uses some more general terms
- Some examples are shown to help understand the concept


**Skimming/Bookmark Material for the Assignment**
1. [Rolling Dice Examples](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Basic_Programming_With_Python#Program_Example_1_3)
- Examples of solutions to rolling dice
- A new good resource about solving problems.
