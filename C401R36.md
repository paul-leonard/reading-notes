**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Django Settings Best Practices](https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/)
- many issues can come up when working with large teams or transitioning a django project to production
- there is no universal way to configure Django settings to prevent these issues, but there are many books and open-source methods to provide guidance
- settings_local.py: a file that is ignored by VCS and contains all of the environmental settings; is python code
- A settings folder with settings files for each environment: all info developers need is there, but need another way to handle secret keys
- Environment variables: this has several issues including KeyError exceptions and datatypes
- heroku developed the 12 Factors (or steps for web development): Codebase, Dependencies, Config, Backing services, Build, release, run, Processes, Port binding, Concurrency, Disposability, Dev/prod parity, Logs, Admin processes


1. [SSH Tutorial](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)
- Secure Shell (SSH) encrypted remote administration protocol
- can use it to remote into remote servers over the internet
- encrypted, modern replacement for Telnet
- can execute shell commands just as if you were working on that actual computer
- SSH commands have 3 parts:  `ssh {user}@{host}`
- host can be an IP address or a domain name
- [basic SSH commands](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh/basic-ssh-commands)
- secure transmission of data between the host and the client
- 3 different encryption technologies are used by SSH
- Symmetric Encryption: a secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data
- Asymmetric Encryption: uses a public-private key pair to encrypt and decrypt the data
- Hashing: Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) to show authenticity of messages
