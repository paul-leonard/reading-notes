### Class 11: Linear Regressions

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [How to Run Linear Regression in Python](http://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)
- *NOTE: Since this demo was published 'scikit-learn' has been updated. The 'train_test_split' function is now imported from 'sklearn.model_selection'*
- the example uses the least squares method to define the linear relationship
- they use 13 inputs into their model
- important to have two seperate datasets... one for training and one for testing
- dividing datasets into two must be done randomly
- residual plots should look like a random collection around the line equal to zero
- if there seems to be a pattern in a residual plot, then some relationship is not being considered


1. [Linear Regression in Python](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/)
- great in depth explanation of quality linear regression including visualizations
- basic steps: import packages and classes, provide data, create a model and fit it, get results, predict response
- the package can also do polynomial regression

1. [Introduction to Simple Linear Regressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsVBBJRb9TE)
- linear regression identifies an estimated linear equation to represent a line
- the described line provides an estimated dependent variable output for an independent variables input
- the equation follows the format: y = b0(x) + b1 + error
