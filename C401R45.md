### Class 45: Graphs

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Graphs *by Code Fellows*](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

Wonderful resource with pictures summarizing graphs well.  I recommend referencing it instead of these notes:)

Terms
Vertex/node: a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
- Edge: a connection between two nodes
- Neighbor: adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge
- Degree (of a vertex): the number of edges connected to that vertex
- Cycle: a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex

Directed vs Undirected
- Directed: a graph where every edge is directed.
- Undirected: a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional

Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
- Complete: a graph where all nodes are connected to all other nodes
- Connected: a graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge
- Disconnected: a graph where some vertices may not have edges

Acyclic vs Cyclic
- Acyclic: a directed graph without cycles
- Cyclic: a graph that has cycles

Ways to Communicate/Docment/Show Graphs
- Graph Representation
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

Weighted Graphs
- different edges can have different weights
- changes adjacency matrix to include weight values instead of binary
- adds additional value for weight to nodes

Traversals
- Breadth First: inside to out, uses queue
- Depth Frist: get far away fast, uses stack
