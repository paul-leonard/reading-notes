### Class 9: Refactoring and Functional Programming

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Functional Programming Concepts)](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
- pure functions are deterministic meaning if given the same input, they return the same output
- reading files is not a pure function
- any randomness makes a function unpure
- pure functions do not modify global varibles
- pure functions are easier to read and test
- use immutable data; if you need a value changed... create a new variable
- a function returning the same value for the same inputs is called referential transparency
- *functions as first class entities* means that functions can be treated as *values* and used as *data*
- *higher order functions* means either the function 1) takes one or more functions as arguments AND/OR 2) returns a function as a result
- filter, map, and reduce are examples of common and extremely useful higher order functions


1. [Refactoring Javascript for Readability)](https://dev.to/healeycodes/refactoring-javascript-for-performance-and-readability-with-examples-1hec)
- refactoring code can make it shorter and easier to read
- return early from functions: instead of if=true do this code block; say if=false, jump out of this line of code.  The practice removes indentions and curly brackets.
- cache variables by replacing typical indexes (i,j,k,l) with more descriptive names
- check for web APIs before creating your own function
