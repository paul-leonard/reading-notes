#### Duckett: HTML & CSS

##### Chapter #5: Images (pages 94-125)
The HTML tag '<img>' is used to add image elements to web pages.  Two attributes must be included with every HTML image tag.  The first is the source attribute called 'src' and defines where the image is to be found.  The second is the 'alt' attribute which describes the content for screen readers to describe the image.  To shorten download speeds, the images should only be stored at the appropriate resolution and size that the website requires.  Format of the image is also important.  JPEG format is the best choice for photographs, while simpler logos or illustrations should be formated as GIFs.

##### Chapter #11: Color (pages 246-263)
Selecting color for your website is very important part of design.  There are many elements that can have colors defined and the color possibilities are endless.  The Adobe Color Wheel can help you choose a color scheme that provides appropriate contrast and is pleasing to the eye.  It can also make sure your website is accessible for colorblind people.  You can also change the Opacity of colors in CSS3.

There are three ways you can define color:
- RGB values
- HEX codes
- color names

The chrome browser dev tools have an accessability tool for helping choose appropriate contrasting colors for websites.  The information below explains the features and uses:

##### Chapter #12: Text (pages 264-299)
The presentation of text is important to a website and contributes signifcantly to the design and user experience.  There are many properties which can be set to change the font, size, style, weight, and spacing of text.  However, witht he wide variety of browsers and outdated versions available in the world, the acceptable choice of fonts to use on a website is limited.  In addition to changing the typeset itself, the white space surrounding it is equally important.  Line spacing, paragraph spacing, spacing betweens words, and spacing between individual letters also change the appearance and readability of a website.  Alignment to the left, right, center, or justified can also shape paragraphs and headings.  Indentures can be used to signify new paragraphs.  *Pseudo-classes* can be used to modify or change the appearance of text when a certain action is taking place or has taken place in the past.
