### Class 12: EJS Partials

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**

1. [EJS Partials](https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433)
- very useful when repeatitive parts of the site rely on reusing the same HTML for multiple views
- think of partials as functions for rendering HTML
- create seperate EJS files for each partial
- the partials themselves do not need to contain any JS... the examples were all written in HTML
- in the EJS files, any JS (or non-HTML code) is surrounded by tags like these: `<% %>`
- to make use of the partial files, we *include* (or call for them) using `<%- include(<PARTIAL_FILE>) %>` where the template is relevant.
- it is not clear to me if the - is needed or if it was an example of what not to do.  So far, I think it is needed.



1. [WalkThroughCode Video Series: EJS Partials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xEEH4fTEk&t=0s&index=7&list=PL7sCSgsRZ-slYARh3YJIqPGZqtGVqZRGt)
- Put together by the YouTube channel *WalkThroughCode*
- Explains how it will be useful in repeating common things across pages using a layout.ejs
- Especially easy to use and helpful for bits of HTML that are static and repetitive
- quick and easy demo of how quick and easy using partials of static HTML code is!
