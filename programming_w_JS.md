### Class 7: Programming with JavaScript (JS)

**Reading Material for the Assignment**
- Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery:
- Intro + Scripts: Pages 1 - 24
- Expressions + Operators: 74 - 79
- Functions: 88 - 94



#### Scripts
A script is a set of instructions a computer can follow.  When developing a script, it is important to understand the overall goal of the program.


####  Expressions and Operators
Expressions use an equal sign to assign a new value to a variable.  Some expressions just assign one value.  Other expressions evaluate two or more values to come up with a new single value.  If more than one value are considered, operators work on the multiple values to find the new value.  There are two main types of operators.

*Arithmetic Operators* These are mathamatical operators you would expect including additon and subraction, among others.

*String Operators* There is only one string operator.  It is '+'.  You can use it to join multiple strings together into one string.


####  Functions
Functions allow the developer to group a portion of code together that accomplishes a particular task and then call that grouping of code.  This allows for the reuse of code that commonly has to be used without copy/pasting the same code all over the place.  This reduces code lines, makes troubleshooting and fixes easier, and makes the code more readable to humans.  Codes can have inputs and/or outputs, but are not required to have either.

*Basic Function Define*
'function funcName() {
    stuff to do
}'

*Basic Function Call*
'funcName();'



#### Key Things to Remember
1. Two ways to define a function.  One is straight forward and one defines and stores the function in a variable.  'function FfncName(input) {code}' and 'var variable = function(input) {code}'
1. Functions provide advantages such as avoiding repeated code, communicating purpose via a well-named function, make code easily reusable, and let us define code once and re-run it repeatedly when needed.
1. A JavaScript function is a reusable set of code which has the ability to operate with or without inputs and with or without outputs.
1. Use parenthesis after the function name to invoke (or call) the function.
1. Function declaration and invocation need to happen seperately.
1.  Functions must be declared before they can be invoked. 
1. The listing order of inputs to a function 'functionName(input1, input2, input3)' are followed and respective when defining the local variables.
