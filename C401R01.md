### Class 1: Assorted Resources to Get Us Going!

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Pain vs. Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)
- Class will be hard, long, and painful.
- Suffering is pain without purpose.
- Our pain has purpose.
- We will be learning and growing a lot to better ourselves.


1. [Beginners Guide to Big O Notation](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
- Used to describe the complexity of an algorithm
- Typically cenetered around the worst-case scenario and the resources it requires
- O(N) has the same time and memory requirements regardless of input size
- O(N) grows lineraly and in direct proportion to the size of the input
- O(N^2) is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input
- O(2^N) describes an algorithm whose performance doubles with each additional piece of input
- These O examples describe problem complexity growing quickly for some problems as input data set sizes increase
- For the example of Logarithms, it is shown that increasing dataset does not have too large of an impact on performance for such things as binary search



**Skimming/Bookmark Material for the Assignment**
1. [Code Newbie Podcast (S1E6):A Friendly Intro to Big O Notation](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs/8)
- Big O is a way to measure an algorithm's performance
- performance is based on time to execute and memory size required
- it's like assigning a grade
- different data structures get different grades for doing different tasks
- consider how you will use your data and its size before selecting a data type (consider Big O)

1. [Names and Values in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)
- data types are deep
- it is important to understand data types and how they are handled to prevent mutable aliasing
- mutable vs immutable values
- immutable types: ints, floats, strings, tuples
- significant difference between rebinding and mutating
- the use of += actually uses __iadd__
- understand assignments, they are everywhere



1. [Awesome Python Environment](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-setup-an-awesome-python-environment-for-data-science-or-anything-else-35d358cc95d5)
- Description of the Python environment and how it all fits together.
- Suggestions for setting up your machine to make things easier and provide the best experience.

1. [Python Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/3/index.html)
- Series of articles introducing and demonstrating the modules available in the Python 3 standard library.
- Looks like an excellent resource for understanding the standard library and how to use it... and what is available.
