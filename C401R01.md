## Code #401

### Class 1: Assorted Resources to Get Us Going!

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Pain vs. Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)
- Class will be hard, long, and painful.
- Suffering is pain without purpose.
- Our pain has purpose.
- We will be learning and growing a lot to better ourselves.


1. [Beginners Guide to Big O Notation](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
- Used to describe the complexity of an algorithm
- Typically cenetered around the worst-case scenario and the resources it requires
- O(N) has the same time and memory requirements regardless of input size
- O(N) grows lineraly and in direct proportion to the size of the input
- O(N^2) is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input
- O(2^N) describes an algorithm whose performance doubles with each additional piece of input
- These O examples describe problem complexity growing quickly for some problems as input data set sizes increase
- For the example of Logarithms, it is shown that increasing dataset does not have too large of an impact on performance for such things as binary search
