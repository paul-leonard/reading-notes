### Class 29: Django Custom User

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Django Custom User Model](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)
- this is a tutorial on creating a Django custom user model with guidance that is better than the documentation because it makes use of best practices
- Django containsa a built-in user model that can be used for authentication 
- however, it is officially recommended to always build a custom model for any new project
- the Django documentation shows an example of how to make a custom model, however, it does not make use of some best practices
- it is important to not migrate database configuration before creating your custom user model
- There are two ways to create custom user models: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser
- AbstractBaseUser is much more difficult and requires more work than AbstractUser
- Creating a custom user model requires:  creating a project, creating an app, updating settings.py, creating a CustomUser model, creating new UserCreation and UserChangeForm, and updating the admin.
- After those steps are done, we can makemigrations and then migrate
- templates will need to be created to handle login page and signup pages
