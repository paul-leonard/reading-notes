### Class 8: Operators and Loops

**Reading Material for the Assignment**
1. Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery:
- Comparison and logical operators: 150-151, 156, and 157
- For and While Loops: 170-173, and 176



#### Comparison Operators Evaluating Conditions
Compares the value of two operands.

Code | Use
--- | ---
'==' | Is equal to
'===' | strict equal to
'>' | greater than
'<' | less than
'!=' | is not equal to
'!==' | strict not equal to
'>=' | greater than or equal to
'<=' | less than or equal to

#### Logical Operators
Logical operators allow you to compare multiple comparison operators.

Code | Use
--- | ---
'&&' | logical and
'||' | logical or
'!' | logical not

#### Loops
Loops check a condition and continuously run a section of code until the conditon is no longer met.

##### For Loops
For loops execute their code a certain number of times and increment their counter each time they execute the code.

##### While Loops
While loops execute their code while certain, usually external, conditions are true.

##### Do While Loops
Do while loops are similar to While loops, but guarantee the code will be executed at least once.  Even if the conditional statement is not true.

##### Key Parts of a Loop
Name | Code
--- | ---
initialization | 'var i = 0;'
condition | 'i < 10;'
update | 'i++'

*'i++' increments the counter by one*



##### Examples of Where to Use Which Loops
Example   |  Best Loop
---   |   ---
Ensuring user has entered a numeric value | While
Restricting access until a correct password is entered | While
Showing each of the products in a shopping cart | For
Displaying all the books on a digital bookshelf | For
