## About Me
Thank you for visiting my page of notes.  I hope they were helpful to you.  Please also check out [my GitHub portfolio page](https://github.com/paul-leonard "Paul's GitHub Portfolio").

After graduating with a **mechanical engineering** degree from *Missouri University of Science and Technology* 13 years ago, I moved out to Seattle and started work at Boeing.  While there, I worked in **airplane modifications, flight test, and flight controls design engineering**.  I am super excited to return to a rich learning environment and gain some new **software development** skills.  I plan to complete the full course path ending with a specialty in **Python**.  I enjoy spending time outside by camping and hiking or having a beer at a brewery with friends (when that is a thing again).
