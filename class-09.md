#### Duckett: HTML & CSS

##### Chapter #7: Forms (pages 144-175)
- Forms allow users to input information to the webapage and, thereby, the associated server.
- Form information is sent using name/value pairs.
- The *form control* is given a name by the website programmer.
- Never change a name of the form control wihtout proper coordination with the server being sent information.
- There are many different types of forms, from radio buttons and checkboxes, to text fields and password entry, to file upload and drop down lists.
- You can use an image as your button.


Chapter #14: Lists, Tables, and Forms (pages 330-357)
- Likely to be my favorite, this chapter specifies bullet point styles.
- CSS contains specific properties for working with tables, lists, and forms.
- 'empty-cells' is a property that specifies how cells that contain no content should render.  The browser typically treats them different and may show their borders in unexpected ways.
- 'border-collapse' changes a table from looking like the 90s to looking like Excel.
- Use of styling fieldsets and legends can make forms easier to read for the user by grouping inputs and showing which inputs are required.
- Aligning form controls takes work.
- [Recommended CSS chrome extension tool](www.chrispederick.com/work/web-developer)
- It is good to make your form feel interactive and responsive to the user.


#### Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

##### Chapter #6: Events (pages 243-292)
- Events registered by the browser can trigger different or additional code to run.
- Responding to user actions in this way makes the website feel more interactive.
- There are many types of events.  Some major catagories include:  UI, Keyboard, Mouse, Focus, Form, Mutation.
- Events *fire* or are *raised*
- Events *trigger* scripts
- Three steps to have events trigger code
1. Select Element
2. Specify Event
3. Call Code
- Event flow and event capturing must be considered.
- *Binding* is linking an event and element
