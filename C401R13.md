### Class 13: Trees

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)
- *node* - individual item/data
- *root* - first/top node in the tree
- *left child* - node positioned to the left of a root node
- *right child* - node positioned to the right of a root node
- *edge* - the link between nodes
- *leaf* - node that has no children
- *height* - determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node
- Traversals can travel in two different ways: Depth first and Breadth First
- There are three types of depth first traversals:  *pre-order* (root, left, right), *in-order* (left, root, right), and *post-order* (left, right, root)
- Depth first traversals utilize recursion and the call stack
- Breadth first traversals utilize a Queue data structure
- In a binary tree, each node only can have two children
- Nodes are typically added to the first node that does not have two children while traveling on a breadth traversal
- nodes are allowed to be placed anywhere, though
- Big O Time Complexity for inserting a new node is O(n)
- Big O Space Complexity for inserting a new node is O(w), where w is the width of the tree
- Perfect binary tree is a tree where all nodes that have children, have two children
- Max width for a perfect binary tree is 2^(h-1), where h is height
- height of a perfect binary tree can be calculated using log n, where n is the number of nodes
- the height of the most unperfect binary tree is n, where n is the number of nodes
- Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a way to find values quickly in a tree
- In a BST, the left node is less than the right node, when two nodes exist
- each node serves as a gate to decide which way to go and reduce the search size by half
- During BST usage, a while loop continues until a leaf is hit or the value is found
- The Big O Time Complexity for a BST insertion and search operations is O(h), where h is the height
- The Big O Space Complexity for a BST search is O(1)
