### Class 38: Cryptography

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Ceasar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- A Ceaser Cipher is simply just shifting the alphabet by a set number of letters
- the shift is consistent thoughout the alphabet and the message
- because only 25 shifts are possible, it is pretty simple to break using a brute force attack by "completing the plain component"
- the encryption can also be broken by analyzing the distribution of letters in the message
- E and T are most frequently used letters in the English alphabet
- Q and Z are typically the least frequently used letters in the English alphabet


1. [Cryptography Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o)
- a super sweet video!
- barely worth taking notes
- just watch the 12 minute video again
- the host offers excellent fast-paced explanations for many types of cryptography in a very condensed timeline
- public and private key combinations are explained
- explanation of how private/private symetric keys are used and why they are difficult to break
