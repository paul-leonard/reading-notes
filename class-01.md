#### Duckett: HTML & CSS

##### Chapter 0: Introduction (pages 2-11)
Brown background pages are **reference** and introduce key pieces of information and code.  Diagram and infographics are shown on a black background page.  Blue pages are chapter summaries.  There are 3 sections to the book: HTML, CSS, and Practical.

##### Chapter 1: Structure (pages 12-39)
HTML uses elements to define the structure of a webpage.  Elements are made up of tags.  Tags have opening and closing brackets.  An example of tags can be seen in this code of paragraph tags: '<p> content </p>'.  Tags usually come in pairs, but some are single brackets and are called "empty".

Opening brackets of HTML elements may optionally contain attribute definitions to alter the element.  Attribute definition includes a name and value.  Ex: 'lang="en-us"'

##### Chapter 8: Extra Markup (pages 176-199)
There are different versions of HTML due to its evolution.  Therefore, html documents must declare which version of HTML they are written in.

'<!-- comments -->' is how you comment in HTML code.

It is important to be able to refer to the different structure parts within HTML from CSS style files.  To help with this, HTML has two very helpful attirbutes of ID and Class.  Only 1 instance of an ID can exist in an HTML file.

Block elements start on new lines.  Inline elements, like links, go right where they are placed.

iFrame is an inline frame of another website.

Escape characters require special notations due to their use in code syntax.

##### Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout (pages 428-451)
HTML5 is pretty new.  It provides new types of elements with more descriptive names to help readability and reduce the need for class attribute usage.  These more descriptive names also help search engines and screen reader applications to help increase web accessability.

##### Chapter 18: Process & Design (pages 452-475)
It is important to consider the users when building a site.  Think through their key motivations and specific goals.

Use card sorting to help develop a logical site map.  Wire framing is also an important process to help layout your website design before you starting putting code to screen.

Visual design provides and communicates important information to the user.  Visual design should consider:
- content
- prioritizing
- organizing
- visual hierarchy
- grouping
- similarity

**Grouping and Similarity Design Practices**
- prorximity
- closure
- continuance
- white space
- color
- borders

**Considerations for Navigational Design**
- concise
- clear
- selective
- context
- interactive
- consistent



#### Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

##### Chapter 0: Introduction (pages 1-10)
Brown background pages are **reference** and introduce key pieces of information and code.  Diagram and infographics are shown on a black background page.  There are summary pages at the end of each chapter.  There are 2 sections to the book: Core Concepts and Practical Applications.

##### Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming (pages 11-52)
A script is a series of tasks coded in a syntax that the computer can follow.  Flow charts are helpful in developing a script to perform an objective.

Computers and programs create models of the world.  *Objects* and *properties* represent real world things and information.  *Events* occur and trigger *methods* to change the *properties* of the *objects*.

When you view a webpage, you are not looking at the HTML code.  The web browser used the HTML, CSS, and JS to create a **Document Object Model**
