### Class 42: React 2

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [React- Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- multipage tutorial with content presented in sepecific order
- last 5 tutorials of Basic Concepts are linked below and build on each other
- helpful and concise explanations and definition of terms

**[React - Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)**
- create elements based off of the current state
- use *if* or *conditional ([ternary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)) operator* to create only certain elements
- ternary: `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`
- ternaries can carry across lines
- can use variables to store elements
- **stateful component** contains logic to determine what to return as the element to render
- can use `{}` to embed expressions in JSX [more info](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx)
- "It works because in JavaScript, true && expression always evaluates to expression, and false && expression always evaluates to false.  ...  Therefore, if the condition is true, the element right after && will appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it."
- return `null` if you don't want something to show

**[React - Lists & Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)**
- array.map is a way to transform arrays in JS
- "In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical."
- can build collections of elements and use the list/array inside of JSX inside of `{}`
- components can accept an array of numbers within props
- a *key* is a special string attribute that is required when creating lists of elements

**[React - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)**
- HTML form elements typically have their own internal state
- This can lead to confusion about state between HTML and React
- *Controled Components* makes the HTML form state controlled by React; React becomes the "single source of truth"
- `<textarea>` in React has a value attribute instead of using its child to define the text to display
- select tag default position is differently selected in HTML vs React
- tutorial recommends [*Formik*](https://formik.org/) if need complex forms and validation, but state is still a consideration

**[React - Lifting State](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)**
- typically, many components will change based off of a common state
- best to have that common state handled at their closest common ancestor

**[React - Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)**
- powerful composition model
- recommended to use composition instead of inheritance when reusing code across components
- *specialization* uses a more generic component and render it more specifically through the use of props

1. [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- React is a great way to build big and fast web apps using JavaScript
- it makes you think about apps as you build them
- tutorial of the thought process while building a searchable product data table



**Skimming/Bookmark Material for the Assignment**
1. [React - Comprehensive Guide](https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/)
- in depth guide that looks nicely done
