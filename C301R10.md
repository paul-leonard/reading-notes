### Class 10: The Call Stack and Debugging

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [The Call Stack defined on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)
- *Call Stack* is a mechanism for keeping track of multiple functions called as a program executes
- it is used by an interpreter (example: JS interpreter in a browser)
- functions get added to the stack as they are called
- when a funciton is complete, it is taken off the stack
- it then starts working on the next function already in the stack
- if the stack gets larger than has been allocated for, a *stack overflow" error occurs.


1. [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)
- JS engine is a single threaded interpreter
- understanding the heap and single call stack will bring clarity
- good visuals and example showing how it works
- code execution is synchronous
- LIFO - Last In, First Out


1. [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)
- This article provides insights to the errors we are seeing in the terminal
- Error types include:  Reference, Syntax, Range, Type
- the console.log is a crucial tool for debugging code



**Skimming/Bookmark Material for the Assignment**
1. [JavaScript errors reference on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors)
- Full list of possible errors
- when we see an error, we can look it up here for more information.
