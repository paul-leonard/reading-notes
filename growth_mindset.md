### Growth Mindset

#### Definition
**Growth Mindset** is the philosophy, attitude, and approach to life that believes your talents and intellect is not a fixed quantity and can be changed through intentional effort.  Through a growth mindset, people can learn new things and expand their abilities not just by learning new skills, but by improving and increasing the types of things they are "good" at such as:  understanding, ability to learn, math, reading speed, and sports.

#### Great Ways to Stay in the Growth Mindset
1. Any statement of not knowing how to do something ends with the word, "yet".
2. Criticisms and corrections are bits of key information to help you learn how to do things better.
3. The success of others learning new things means that you can learn those things too.
