### Class 33: Authentication & Production Server

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
- open standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
- compact and self-contained JSON object that is used to securely transmit credentials
- digitally signed
-secret using the HMAC algorithm or a public/private key pair using either RSA or ECDSA
- signed tokens provide verification of the integrity of the claims
- signed tokens with public/private keys certify the private key holder signed it
- encryption would be an additional step and prevents others from reading these contents
- JWT = JSON Web Tokens
- Can be used for Authorization
- commonly used with Single Sign On features
- can be used for Information Exchange to provide confirmation of the sender and that the contents has not beeen tampered with
- Consists of three parts seperated by dots:  header, payload, and signature
- header includes: type of token and the signing algorithm used


1. [DRF JWT Authentication](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html)
- JWT is an authorization token that should be included in all requests
- JWT is obtained through an exchange for the username+password for both an access token and refresh token
- access token disappears after ~5 minutes
- refresh token lasts ~24 hours
- both time frames are customizable
- - information within JWT is encoded using Base64
- signature is verified upon each request
- the secret key is used to verify that the signature, header, and payload are correct
- secret keys are to be kept secret
- DRF developers recommend the library: [djangorestframework_simplejwt](https://github.com/davesque/django-rest-framework-simplejwt)
