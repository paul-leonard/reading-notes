[Google and AI](https://gizmodo.com/in-reversal-google-says-its-ai-will-not-be-used-for-we-1826649327)
- This article discussed Google's involvement in Project Raven under a contract with the US DoD.  The initial purpose of this project was to use AI within drones to evaluate videos and identify possible targets.  A lot of the employees started standing up and saying they did not want to be a part of it.  The line moved back and forth for awhile.  First it moved towards developing software that would only perform the surveillance, but would not actively attack the target.  However, employees were still upset because the work would pave the way for the following step of weaponizing the AI.  This reminded me of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle conference I attended around 2005.  Many of the speakers and hallway discussions were about the ethics of UAVs... and the difference between using them for surveillance and attacks.  I remember many of those "experts" thinking, hoping, and believing UAV usage would remain non-weaponized.  It did not take long.  I think the Google employees were unwilling to create something to actively kill people using the strong advantage of AI and voiced their opinion.  I think it was good they were able to draw the line and identify what they were willing to work on, and what not.  Whether that decision was best on unfair advantage or because they believed AI was not ready for that task and could go astray, they stuck to their values.

[Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)
- This article had an interesting historical perspective on big data.  It discussed how data has always been around, but it was always limited by one of the V's:  Volume, Velocity, or Variety.  Computing power and storage would make users pick two of the three.  However, with advanced technology, the choice no longer needs to be made.  You can have all three.  And with that, you no longer have to predetermine what *specific* and *limited* data you want to collect.  This meant you had to know what you were going to do with the data and it was very pointed.  Now you can collect all the data and figure out what you want to do with it later.  You can find new interesting correlations to make... or you can have machine learning do that for you.  And with that, you can compound racial and economic injustices that already exist.  The Black community currently has less generational wealth than the white community.  This could lead to higher credit scores for the white community.  However, if you can't judge off of race... maybe a machine learning algorithm determines that listening to rap music is an indicator for less financial security... and thereby decides to offer less appealing credit to the rap community.  Relying on data in such a way can further perpetuate the same cycles and complicate problems further without explicit realization.  It does seem like an unstable system to me that would lead to many divergences.
