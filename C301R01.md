#### [Shay Howe’s intro to RWD](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/)
- Different viewport sizes and aspect ratios are numerous as internet use on mobile phones and tablets becomes more common than desktop web use.  To handle these variations, websites must be designed to accomodate the different media.  Responsive web design handles changes positively and is considered better than adaptive and and mobile design.
- A mobile first web design approach reduces the amount of downloads and processing that must be accomplished by a mobile device.  This helps speed things up, reduce data usage, and save battery power.
- Layouts need to be flexible.
- Media queries can be used to understand the size, color spectrum, and limitations that are avaialble to a particular web session.  They can be done in both HTML and CSS, but CSS is preferred.
- Flexible media must also be considered to make sure images resize.  The simpliest way to do this includes use of code such as:
`img, video, canvas {
  max-width: 100%;
}`

#### [All About Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)
- CSS Floats are a way to position different HTML elements within a webpage.
- Options include: *left, right, none, or inherit*.
- Floats have some unique strong points, but more powerful tools currently exisit such as **Flexbox** and **Grid**.
- Float's sister property is *clear*.
- Float's four valid values: *both, eft, right, and none*.  The value defines which floats to ignore and determines where the element it is applied to will go.
- Using clear will have the applied element act kind of like a new block element in HTML.
- *The Great Collapse* refers to the parent containing element of several floats collapsing to a height of zero.  This can cause layout complications and must be dealt with.  Typically fixed by clearing the float before the close of the container... but after all floating elements have been floated.
- Floats are pretty much the only way to have text flow around an inset image.
- **Ways to Clear a Float**
1. `clear: both;` in the immeadiate following element, if you know what element that will be.
1. Insert an empty div after the floated div that includes `clear: both;`
1. On the parent (containing element), could set overflow to *auto* or *hidden*.
1. Use the CSS pseduo selector `:after` and then apply it to a class for any element that contained floats. 


#### [Don't Overthink It Grids](https://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/)
Grids can be entirely simple and just floats inside of a container.  The inner elements are width sized using percentages.  The containing element is set to `auto`.

#### [CSS Floats Explained By Riding An Escalator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-floats-explained-by-riding-an-escalator-57fa55232333/)
- Using floats can take from one normal flow to a three flow environment: normal, left, and right.
- Clear means that the next element must start vertically (in most cases) below the last element that was floated (for a given flow).  That means that if clear both is assigned, then the new element will be below everything.  If clear left was selected, the new element would be below the items floated left, but not necessarily below the floated right elements.
