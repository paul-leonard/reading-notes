### Class 15: Diversity and Inclusion

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. Consider the history: [Silicon Valleyâ€™s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/)
- 70% of tech companies in Silicon Valley were male in 201
- The 1970s and 1980s saw a lot of women going through comp sci programs, but then began falling
- likely caused by video game market and advertising
- video game market became over saturated around 1982
- bad games and poor design eroded consumer confidence
- video game market dropped 97% in 1983
- companies saw mainly only males left playing, so they targeted them with ads and games
- females not being targeted, had less exposure to video games and computers
- kicked off a chicken-and-the-egg cycle
- In 1994, at carnegie Mellon University... no women tested past the intro programming class while 40% of their male collegues did.  Likely due to previous computer and video game exposure.
