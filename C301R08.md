### Class 8: SQL

**Reading Material (or Exercise) for the Assignment**
1. [Complete SQLBolt (Intro, Lessons 1-4, 13-18)](http://sqlbolt.com/)
- Nice and quickly moving tutorial to learn the commands of the SQL langauge.
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- relational database is a collection of two-dimensional tables that are related.
- you can use SQL to query, manipulate, and transform data
- can use the information in the database to learn things
- There are many popular SQL databases including:  SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server
- The tutorial introduced the syntax of the language and possible commands.  However, it is not worth typing them all out here.  I need to save my wrists:)  Instead, checkout the SQL Cheat Sheet linked below in the Boomark section.


1. [Practice SQL on W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)
- This resource has sample databases you can use to practice writing SQL queries.
- Can interact with the database in the browser and see your search results in real time.
- A great place to try out commands and see if they work and return what you expect.


**Skimming/Bookmark Material for the Assignment**
1. [Book: A Primer on SQL](https://openlibra.com/en/book/download/a-primer-on-sql-3rd-edition)
- A book to use as reference
- pretty short at 65 pages
- says it is a great intro to SQL

1. [SQL Cheat Sheet](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/sites/sql.su/)
- A huge cheat sheet with helpful information of all of the possible commands
- It says it has the whole language on one page
